Project description:
Playable Game. The game in question is unnamed. The game is pretty straight forward. It's about eliminating (that's right) the Pokemon in the game. I have also included a boss battle, upon completion leads to the end of the game. The project is checked for memory errors, using valgrind. Also, I rectified a couple of bugs, I found in my earlier assignment.
NOTE- There are no memory leaks. I verified it (for an unhealthy number of times!) with the previous projects. the leak summary is consistent with previous projects, all are from the SDL Library.


How you made your sprites: 
All of the sprites and the background are the creative work of others. Raindrop is the only thing that I created. That was using inkscape and gimp. The background images are a combination of Google searches. Following is where I found the sprites.
